## Theses

**Master Thesis: Single- and Multi-fidelity Bandits in Monte Carlo Tree Search**
*From the casino to mobile network optimization*
The thesis adapts Monte Carlo tree search algorithms, originally designed to play the board game Go, to the problem of mobile network optimization and discrete blackbox optimization. The novel Multi-fidelity UCT algorithm is particularly well suited to optimizing expensive blackbox functions, such as hyperparameter tuning in machine learning.

**Bachelor Thesis: A Fairly Complete Qualitative Analysis of a Discrete SIR Epidemiological Model**
The thesis studies the local dynamics and bifurcations of a discrete-time SIR model. The existence of a 3-cycle is shown algebraically, which by Sharkovskii's theorem implies cycles of arbitrary length. A proof using directed graphs is presented. The thesis was later reworked into a published research paper.
