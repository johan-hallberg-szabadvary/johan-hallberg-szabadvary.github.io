**Industrial PhD Student in Computational Mathematics**
<br>*Stockholm University* and *Jönköping University*

I am a mathematician and data scientist bridging the gap between rigorous theory and industrial application.

My research focuses on **Conformal Prediction**, **Time-Series Forecasting**, and **Reliable Machine Learning**. I divide my time between academic research at Stockholm University and applying these methods in production at **Jönköping Energi** and **Siemens Energy**.

Prior to my career in mathematics, I worked professionally in the performing arts as an actor and musician. I remain active in the local music scene on the Swedish West Coast.
