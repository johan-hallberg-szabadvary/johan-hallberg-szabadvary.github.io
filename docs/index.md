**Industrial PhD Student in Computational Mathematics**
<br>*Stockholm University* and *Jönköping University*

I am a mathematician and researcher bridging the gap between **rigorous statistical theory** and **safety-critical industrial applications**.

My research focuses on **Conformal Prediction**, **Sequential Analysis**, and the **Information Geometry of Blindness**. I am interested in the fundamental limits of safety monitoring: *When can we mathematically guarantee that a black-box model is safe, even in dynamic, non-exchangeable environments?*

I currently divide my time between academic research at Stockholm University and Jönköping University and applying these frameworks as a Research Engineer at **Qamcom Research & Technology**, specializing in Uncertainty Quantification for safety-critical systems.

**A Non-Traditional Path**
Prior to my career in mathematics, I spent over a decade as a professional actor and musician. I view mathematical proof and musical performance as similar disciplines—both requiring rigorous preparation and structural clarity. I remain active in the music scene on the Swedish West Coast.
